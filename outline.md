## SIMPLE DESIGN
 - make a form that grabs data, it should scale to take in a number of data points
 - draw an SVG Line between these data points
 - allow more than one line to be plotted
 - take in a min and max value for both X and Y axis
 - take a title for the graph
 - possibly allow graph to be saved as a pdf
